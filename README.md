Step 2:  Univariate Analysis 
- Drop columns with null values, all random values or single category value
- Convert values to proper int, float, date representations
Step 3: Segmented Univariate Analysis
- Analyze variables against segments of other variables
- Create derived variables

Step 4: Bivariate Analysis
- Do correlation analysis Check how two variables affect each other or a third variable
- Plot Heat Maps to  Analyze correlations

Step 5: Important Factors & Recommendations
